 * an array of input selectors and a function that will return the value

  ... then the selector selectCartItemsCount needs to reference
  [selectCartItems] which references [selectCart]. So it passes
  the state in const selecCart, gets the cart object
  const selectCart = (state) => state.cart;
  which gets passed into the function cart => cart.cartItems which
  passes out the cartItems which are selectCartItemsCount because it's
  relying on the selector passes the cartItems into the function cartItems
  export const selectCartItemsCount = createSelector(
  [selectCartItems],
  (cartItems) =>
  which finally reduces over and gives us our actual final cartItems
  count which we then pass in as item which we then pass in as itemCount as
  a prop into our cartIcon component in file cart-icon.component.jsx
  const CartIcon = ({ toggleCartHidden, ITEMCOUNT }) =>
  const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
   ITEMCOUNT: selectCartItemsCount(state),
};
