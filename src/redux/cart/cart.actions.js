 * array that we just made and what will return is this new action
 * type object where the type is our CartActionTypes.ADD_ITEM which
 * will tell our reducer "hey I'm trying to add this item and the payload
 * will be equal to the item
 * An action can take a type and a payload. The payload can be
 * anything we want it to be. Here we want it to be the item we're trying
 * to add into our cart items array   */
